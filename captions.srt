00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:05,460
hey everyone I'm Brian I'm excited to be

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,980
joining you all at mux on the pipe from

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,620
engineering team a little bit about me I

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,880
grew up in New Jersey until I went off

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,820
to college at Virginia Tech go Hokies uh

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,760
and after college I moved to Northern

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,220
Virginia which is right outside DC I've

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,680
worked at various companies and kind of

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,980
found my Niche really loving building

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,500
reliable systems that are distributed

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,440
and have really unique problems that I

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,120
feel like I can help solve and and I

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,260
really love making the developer

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,540
experience and running on those

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,879
platforms as enjoyable as possible

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,760
and so that's kind of how I found myself

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,980
in platform engineering before joining

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,079
mux I was part of the platform teams at

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,399
Gannett as well as New Relic and along

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,920
the way uh I adopted My adorable rescue

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,320

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,420
center of my attention uh in my spare

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,019
time I love growing and taking care of

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,220
my plants the more exotic or spicy

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,439

that more now but I really missed that

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,299

29
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,520
